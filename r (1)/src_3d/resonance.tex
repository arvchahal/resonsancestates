1. Generate an accurate basis with small dimension. Include photon
spaces. 
2. Increase the basis without refining to some large dimension.
3. run ecg
4. run ecg_cs (this generates the matrix elements)
5. run spectrum: this generates the energy vs dimension figure spectrum.dat
6. run cs (check the scaling) this will generate gr.dat, the energy vs
rotation angle.
